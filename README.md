# PyCharm PyQGIS setup guide

**Guide to setting up Pycharm for QGIS development**

1. Download the pycharm.bat file and copy it in *C:\OSGeo4W64\bin*.
2. Create a desktop shortcup to the bat and launch it

**Important** do not install PyCharm v2019, it's bugged and it doesn't launch correctly for QGIS development.
